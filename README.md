# Book List

This is basically a book blog backend that I created. The user can create a 'post' or a review about a book, and upon providing a ISBN 10 number for that book (or any printing of that book) a call is made to an API to fetch an image of the cover and display it on the blog. 

The data for each book is kept in a SQL database (PostgreSQL in my case).

There is currently no authentication for the user, but that could be added without too much trouble.
